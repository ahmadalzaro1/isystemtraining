# Security Configuration Guide

This document provides guidance for completing the remaining security configurations in Supabase.

## Database Security âœ… COMPLETED

All database security fixes have been implemented:
- âœ… RLS policies tightened for admin tables
- âœ… Function search paths secured
- âœ… Guest data access rate limiting enhanced
- âœ… Security monitoring and logging implemented

## Supabase Auth Configuration ðŸ”§ REQUIRES MANUAL SETUP

The following settings need to be configured in the Supabase dashboard:

### 1. Reduce OTP Expiry Time
**Location:** Authentication > Settings > Auth
**Current Issue:** OTP expiry exceeds recommended threshold
**Recommended Fix:**
- Set OTP expiry to 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less
- This reduces the window for potential OTP attacks

### 2. Enable Leaked Password Protection
**Location:** Authentication > Settings > Auth
**Current Issue:** Leaked password protection is disabled
**Recommended Fix:**
- Enable "Check passwords against compromised password databases"
- This prevents users from using passwords that have been breached

### 3. URL Configuration (If not done)
**Location:** Authentication > URL Configuration
**Settings:**
- Site URL: Your deployed application URL
- Redirect URLs: Add all valid redirect URLs for your application

## Security Headers âœ… IMPLEMENTED

The following security headers have been added to index.html:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()

## Security Monitoring âœ… IMPLEMENTED

### Client-Side Security
- SecurityEnforcement component monitoring:
  - Suspicious URL parameters
  - Rapid navigation patterns
  - CSP violations
  - Guest access rate limiting

### Server-Side Security
- Enhanced database functions for:
  - Guest data anonymization
  - Failed authentication monitoring
  - Admin activity logging
  - Security event tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Supabase Auth Settings** (Manual):
   - Log into Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to Authentication > Settings
   - Update OTP expiry and enable leaked password protection

2. **Verify Security Headers** (Automatic):
   - Headers are automatically applied via index.html
   - Test with security scanning tools

3. **Monitor Security Events**:
   - Check admin audit logs regularly
   - Review analytics events for suspicious patterns
   - Monitor failed authentication attempts

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators:
- Regularly review audit logs
- Monitor user privilege changes
- Check for unusual data access patterns
- Perform periodic security reviews

### For Development:
- Always test RLS policies thoroughly
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Keep dependencies updated

### For Production:
- Enable HTTPS only
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Monitor application performance and errors
- Implement automated security scanning

## Security Incident Response

If a security issue is detected:
1. Check admin audit logs for unauthorized changes
2. Review security events in analytics
3. Verify RLS policies are functioning correctly
4. Check for unusual authentication patterns
5. Update passwords and revoke suspicious sessions if necessary

## Compliance Notes

This implementation includes:
- Data retention policies with automatic anonymization
- Audit logging for administrative actions
- Rate limiting for guest access
- Personal data protection measures
- Security monitoring and alerting
